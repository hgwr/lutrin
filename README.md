# Lutrin

"Lutrin" is a image viewer. 
You can view images sequentially in a folder by using left/right arrow keys.

Lutrin is possible to display images as a two page spread.
Just like reading a book open, you can view images.

In addition, Lutrin can directly open a zip file.
Archiving image files to a zip file, 
you can view images sequentially in the zip file.
